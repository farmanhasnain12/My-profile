      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="skill-row33">
        <p class="paragrpah1 font-size">I often called him a ‘Sincere Friend’, as it suits his nature. It’s the title I could not give to any other friend. A best friend with whom a lot of good memories were made but it was short termed i.e only for one year. Throwback to when we both were in Faisalabad campus, my perception about him was not positive because he was mostly involved in some barbaric activities like throwing water on the floor and running away after knocking the friend’s door in the hostel. But when we both admitted to Islamabad campus, we became close friends. We spent one year in Islamabad and then he moved to Lahore campus to complete his Bachelors education. The best thing about him is that he always points out my weakness and tries to solve it. A very chill person in general. </p>
