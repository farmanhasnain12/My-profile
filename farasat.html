      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="skill-row33">
        <p class="paragrpah1 font-size">Here comes our second sensitive friend after Talha Malik, he knows all my secrets from my childhood till now. We became friends when I was in 7th grade and because of my sins he is still my friend. All of my friends have a common perception about me that is ‘Cleverness’ and he can easily judge whether I am going to make any clever move or not. The reason behind this is that we mostly spend a lot of time together and discuss the stories about friendship. That might be the case in this scenario. One thing that I want to request from him would be ‘Don’t be fooled if you love’.</p>
