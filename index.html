        <h3>My Weakness</h3>
      <p>Since I mentioned my skills, it is important for me to mention the weaknesses too. My ineptitude in english language is one of my biggest weaknesses. I have many future plans that are based on English language for example, expressing my thoughts about what I feel in the environment and in our society that might differ from the reader’s point of view but I plan on writing it down in the form of a book. So when the first step of improving my english is done I will enter the second step.</p>
