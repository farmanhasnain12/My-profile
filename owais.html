      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="skill-row33">
        <p class="paragrpah1 font-size">He is my university friend. As far as I remember, we became friends in Linear Algebra class through discussing assignments. And then we mostly met for problem solving related to programming. He is a little bit of a lazy person because he starts his projects/assignments too late. I am also lazy but when I see him I realize that I am not too lazy. But he is a good  guy, having keen interest in learning web development. He also worked as an intern in a famous software company to learn it. He loves to watch Hollywood seasons. He is well and proficient in English; whenever I am stuck in some english related problem, he is the one who solves it.</p>
