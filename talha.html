      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="skill-row33">
        <p class="paragrpah1 font-size">Here comes Talha Malik, who is my school friend; a very sensitive person I have met. I often do not talk to him in an aggressive tone because he mostly gets angry on a small issue. Now on the safe side itâ€™s better for me to make my steps in such a way so as to maintain the friendship and not discuss the matter again. In general, I really like the people who have their future goals in their minds from an early age. When we first met in 8th grade, at that time he told me that he plans on doing CA in the future and as the time passed he carried on with his passion of being a CA (Chartered Accountant). He also started a Youtube channel and he has a keen interest in sharing the political views of some celebrities. I will share some of his videos here on this page! </p>
